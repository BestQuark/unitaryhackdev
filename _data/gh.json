Thus, it will be useful when simulating noisy systems.\r\n\r\nThe theory (and implementation) for SPSA is:\r\n* Described in James C. Spall, \u201c[An Overview of the Simultaneous Perturbation Method for Efficient Optimization](https://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA/PDF-SPSA/Spall_An_Overview.PDF)\u201d, 1998;\r\n* Showcased in the [Optimization using SPSA](https://pennylane.ai/qml/demos/spsa.html) PennyLane tutorial.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it is implemented:\r\n* In the [`noisyopt` package](https://noisyopt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), specifically see [the source code here](https://github.com/andim/noisyopt/blob/master/noisyopt/main.py#L264);\r\n* In Qiskit, [see the SPSA optimizer documentation](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA.html#qiskit.algorithms.optimizers.SPSA).\r\n\r\n### Implementation and acceptance criteria\r\n\r\n#### 1. Implementation\r\n\r\nThere exists a `qml.SPSAOptimizer` optimizer that:\r\n* Implements the `compute_grad` and the `apply_grad` methods ([see `GradientDescentOptimizer.apply_grad` doc](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.html?highlight=gradientdescent#pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.apply_grad) and [`GradientDescentOptimizer.compute_grad` doc](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.html?highlight=gradientdescent#pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.compute_grad));\r\n* Implements a `step` method ([see `GradientDescentOptimizer.step` doc](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.html?highlight=gradientdescent#pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.step));\r\n* Implements a `step_and_cost` method ([see `GradientDescentOptimizer.step_and_cost` doc](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.html?highlight=gradientdescent#pennylane.GradientDescentOptimizer.step_and_cost));\r\n* The `SPSAOptimizer` allows passing values to the quantities that greatly influence the optimization, including:\r\n    * `a`: scaling parameter for step size;\r\n    * `A`: stability constant;\r\n    * `c`: scaling parameter for evaluation step size;\r\n    * `alpha`: scaling exponent for step size;\r\n    * `gamma`: scaling exponent for evaluation step size;\r\n    but also defines defaults suggested in the paper. Such defaults may be of the most practical use in many use cases. E.g., `noisyopt` also uses such defaults, except for `A` that is \"fixed\" based on the number of iteration steps.\r\n#### 2. Testing\r\n\r\nTest the `SPSAOptimizer` class similar to how [`GradientDescentOptimizer`](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/blob/master/tests/optimize/test_gradient_descent.py) and [`QNGOptimizer`](https://github.com/PennyLaneAI/pennylane/blob/master/tests/optimize/test_qng.py) are being tested.\r\n\r\n#### 3. Documentation\r\n\r\nThe documentation of the optimizer should be similar in fashion to the [documentation of the `QNGOptimizer`](https://pennylane.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code/api/pennylane.QNGOptimizer.html?highlight=qngoptimizer#pennylane.QNGOptimizer).\r\n\r\nThe docstring of `qml.SPSAOptimizer` should:\r\n* Introduce the concept of SPSA and the task it solves;\r\n* Include and explain equations (5) and (6) from \u201c[An Overview of the Simultaneous Perturbation Method for Efficient Optimization](https://www.jhuapl.edu/SPSA/PDF-SPSA/Spall_An_Overview.PDF)\u201d (page 9 of the PDF that is page 490 of the volume);\r\n* Mention the number of quantum device executions required with SPSA;\r\n* Mention the use cases for SPSA as the optimization method of a hybrid quantum-classical workflow;\r\n* Add examples for showcasing the use of the optimizer as for `QNGOptimizer`.\r\n\r\n### How important would you say this feature is?\r\n\r\n2: Somewhat important.

Ideas are welcome for how to meaningfully represent the information in an intuitive way at different zoom levels.\r\n- The code graph will need more information than the bare meta-information given in the input data structure. E.g., it will want to build \"code families\", given for instance by collecting all codes that are a descendant of a given code. I'd like for such pre-processing code to be in a separate component/library, in anticipation for possible use also in other parts of the site generation process.

`UCCSD`](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/main/qiskit/chemistry/components/variational_forms/uccsd.py) implementation had a `method_doubles=\"succ_full\"` option which is not yet implemented in Qiskit Nature.\r\nThis option is a variant of the (now named) `SUCCD` option which also includes symmetrically mirrored double excitations, however, using the same parameter as the symmetric counter part (as also noted [here](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/blob/aae9c01b4d02bf5dbaa342c757be2cfef60a31d5/qiskit_nature/circuit/library/ansatzes/succd.py#L34-L35)).\r\n\r\nThe original implementation in Qiskit Aqua came from the work of [this paper](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.5141835) in which sections II.E.2 and appendix E provide more in-depth information.\r\nThe following Qiskit Nature snippet shows the current state of the `SUCCD` ansatz for the example discussed the aforementioned paper's appendix:\r\n```python\r\nfrom qiskit_nature.circuit.library.ansatzes import SUCCD\r\nfrom qiskit_nature.converters.second_quantization import QubitConverter\r\nfrom qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization import JordanWignerMapper\r\n\r\nconverter = QubitConverter(JordanWignerMapper())\r\nansatz = SUCCD(converter, (1, 1), 6)\r\n\r\nprint(ansatz.decompose().draw())\r\nprint(ansatz.excitation_list)\r\n```\r\nwhich outputs:\r\n```\r\n

Waiting times for all auxiliary operators to be mapped can reach on the order of minutes.\r\n\r\nI believe, performance can be significantly improved if we:\r\n- cache the processed `pauli_list` object within `QubitMapper` (requires changing the `mode_based_mapping` from a static to an instance method)\r\n- refactor the iteration to deal with sparse labels rather than dense ones (requires sparse labels to be the default, a conversion of dense to sparse, and updating the `VibrationalOp` to be inline with the `FermionicOp` again; if this gets tackled before said update, we can also handle the mapping `FermionicOp`s separately for the time being)\r\n- potentially do something similar to #638 by constructing a single `SparsePauliOp` from a list of terms rather than performing the full computation each time\r\n\r\nI put together a script which benchmarks the performance of the mapping.\r\n```python\r\nimport time\r\n\r\nfrom matplotlib import pyplot as plt\r\n\r\nfrom qiskit_nature.mappers.second_quantization import JordanWignerMapper\r\nfrom qiskit_nature.operators.second_quantization import FermionicOp\r\n\r\nmapper = JordanWignerMapper()\r\n\r\ntimings = {}\r\n\r\nwith open(\"timings.csv\", \"w\") as file:\r\n    try:\r\n        for size in range(10, 21, 5):\r\n            timings[size] = {}\r\n            for num in range(100, 1001, 100):\r\n                print(f\"Mapping {num} operators of length {size}\", flush=True)\r\n                start = time.time()\r\n                for i in range(num):\r\n                    q_ops = mapper.map(FermionicOp(\" \".join(f\"N_{i}\" for i in range(size)),\r\n                                                   display_format=\"sparse\"))\r\n                stop = time.time()\r\n                timings[size][num] = stop - start\r\n\r\n                file.write(f\"{size},{num},{stop - start}\\n\")\r\n                file.flush()\r\n    except KeyboardInterrupt:\r\n        pass\r\n```\r\nThis will run for a quite a while on latest `main` @ aae9c01.\r\nBelow is the timing report.

[`JsonLog`](https://github.com/netket/netket/blob/master/netket/logging/json_log.py), which is the standard logger and writes log data to a JSON file (and also saves a regularly overwritten snapshot of the current network parameters as a MessagePack file).\r\n2. [`StateLog`](https://github.com/netket/netket/blob/master/netket/logging/state_log.py), which saves intermediate network parameters as a separate file for each step (`1.mpack`, `2.mpack`, `3.mpack`, etc.) to a folder or ZIP file.\r\n\r\nWhile these work, it would be nice for easier data handling and interoperability with other tools to support writing simulation output into a single file in the commonly used [HDF5](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format) format via [`h5py`](https://docs.h5py.org/en/stable/).\r\n\r\n## Implementation notes\r\n\r\nTo resolve this issue, the following should be implemented:\r\n\r\n1. A new logger class `netket.logging.HDF5Log` which writes both the information currently contained in `JsonLog` and the network parameters (at each step or every certain number of steps as it can be configured in `StateLog`) to an HDF5 file specified by the user.\r\n2. The logger needs to be compatible with the current NetKet logging interface, so that it can be used in place of `JsongLog` and `StateLog` in NetKet drivers. (For this PR this means compatibility with the current use of the loggers in [`netket.driver.AbstractVariationalDriver`](https://github.com/netket/netket/blob/master/netket/driver/abstract_variational_driver.py#L56).) Specifically:\r\n    - The logger needs to implement `__call__(self, step, log_data, state)` which is called at [each optimization step](https://github.com/netket/netket/blob/ce60a41328808a6c803e7be63a17d9a54c812b8d/netket/driver/abstract_variational_driver.py#L268) and write the provided data to the HDF5 log file.\r\n    - Since the number of steps (i.e., number of calls to `__call__`) is not known before the start of the simulation, the log must support appending data to the log every at every step (therefore, the datasets within the HDF5 file need to be resized as necessary).\r\n\r\nNote that `log_data` is a dictionary mapping a name to a specific logged quantity. The value can be of several different types. The `HDF5Log` should support scalar numbers, NumPy/JAX arrays, and `netket.stats.Stats` objects.\r\n\r\n- Scalars should be stored as a group with one dataset `values` of shape `(n_steps,)` containing the logged values and another dataset `iters` of the same shape containing the value of `step` at which each entry was logged (compare `JsonLog` output).\r\n- Arrays should be stored in the same way, but with values having shape `(n_steps, *array_shape)`.\r\n- `netket.stats.Stats` are essentially dataclasses with the fields `mean`, `variance`, `error_of_mean`, `tau_corr`, `R_hat`. For a stats object, the log file should contain a group containing each field as a separate dataset (and an `iters` field like above).\r\n\r\nNetKet stores network parameters as JAX pytrees with leaves being complex-valued or real-valued arrays. The `HDF5Log` should store a flattened version (as returned by `netket.jax.tree_ravel`) in a single dataset of shape `(n_steps, n_parameters)`.\r\n\r\nHere is an example layout, showing what a resulting HDF5 log file should contain after 1001 logging steps for a network with 256 variational parameters:\r\n```\r\nName                            Data type       Shape\r\n# network parameters:\r\n/parameters/iters               int             (1001,)\r\n/parameters/values              complex128      (1001, 256)\r\n# an entry of `log_data` called `Energy` of type `netket.stats.Stats`\r\n/data/Energy/iters              int             (1001,)\r\n/data/Energy/mean               complex128      (1001,)\r\n/data/Energy/error_of_mean      float64         (1001,)\r\n/data/Energy/variance           float64         (1001,)\r\n/data/Energy/tau_corr           float64         (1001,)\r\n/data/Energy/R_hat              float64         (1001,)\r\n# an entry of `log_data` called `S_x` of type `netket.stats.Stats`\r\n/data/S_x/iters                 int             (1001,)\r\n/data/S_x/mean                  complex128      (1001,)\r\n/data/S_x/error_of_mean         float64         (1001,)\r\n/data/S_x/variance              float64         (1001,)\r\n/data/S_x/tau_corr              float64         (1001,)\r\n/data/S_x/R_hat                 float64         (1001,)\r\n# an entry of `log_data` called `acceptance` of type `float64`\r\n/data/acceptance/iters          int             (1001,)\r\n/data/acceptance/values         float64         (1001,)\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that for a normal `netket.VMC` run, there is a lot of redundancy in the `.../iters` arrays (as they will all be equal and of the form `[0, 1, ..., n_steps - 1]`). We accept this overhead both for compatibility with the existing `JsongLog` and for the added flexibility it provides for custom logging at subsets of steps.", "closed_by": null}, {"name": "Use colors to signal sampling issues in expectation values", "issue_num": 1201, "value": 50, "number": 1201, "state": "open", "title": "Use colors to signal bad sampling in expectation value/samplers state", "created_at": "2022-05-15T22:28:16Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-30T21:25:16Z", "closed_at": null, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "body": "[This issue is part of [UnitaryHack](https://unitaryhack.dev/) and comes with a bounty of 50$]\r\n\r\n# Context\r\n\r\nCurrently NetKet has a class, `nk.stats.Stats`, which is used to report expectation values, their error, and some convergence estimators:\r\n```\r\n>>> expval = vs.expect(ha)\r\n>>> type(expval)\r\n<class 'netket.stats.mc_stats.Stats'>\r\n>>> expval\r\n-25.4893 \u00b1 0.0054 [\u03c3\u00b2=0.0292, R\u0302=1.0058]\r\n>>> expval.\r\nexpval.R_hat          expval.error_of_mean  expval.mean           expval.tau_corr       expval.variance\r\n```\r\n\r\nthis same structure is used to show some information during VMC optimisation inside of a tqdm progress bar:\r\n```\r\n\u279c python -i Examples/Ising1d/ising1d_sr.py\r\n 31%|\u2588\u2588          | 92/300 [00:04<00:09, 22.00it/s, Energy=-25.4866 \u00b1 0.0053 [\u03c3\u00b2=0.0281, R\u0302=1.0129]]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOften, users do not notice that `R_hat>1.01` and therefore sampling is going bad.

For example, one can create an TFIM with 2 spins as\r\n```python\r\nnk.operator.PauliStrings(hilbert, operators=(\"ZZ\", \"XI\", \"IX\"), weights=(-J, -h, -h))\r\n```\r\nHowever, notice that if we would implement ladder operators such as (X+iY)/2, we would need to sum over two terms. This becomes problematic when we implement e.g. Jordan-Wigner transformations which contain ladder operators at multiple sites, such that the number of terms in the sum in the operators blows up. Currently, NetKet therefore implements a custom version of fermionic operators which does the Jordan-Wigner transformation more efficiently. This is clearly not ideal, and there are many more examples where ladder operators become important.\r\n\r\n**Implementation notes**\r\nTo resolve this issue, we need ladder operators. We can allow the PauliStrings to take strings \"+\" and \"-\" for a ladder operator (X+iY)/2 and (X-iY)/2 respectively. The main difference with other Pauli operators (X, Y, Z, I) is that these operators will often generate matrix elements that are zero. Nevertheless, it will avoid the current behavior of NetKet, which regards X and Y separately in the ladder operators. We can of course also extend this to ladder operators that operate on other hilbert space than just Qubit and Spin.\r\n\r\nThe implementation requires parsing the input strings to detect \"+\" and \"-\" gates, and to create connected elements accordingly. More than that, NetKet also allows a researcher to do symbolic manipulations with PauliStrings, and any new type of operator would have to implement this as well. Hence, we need to implement the commutation relations and so on.\r\n\r\nCurrently, NetKet parses the PauliStrings as follows in order to compute matrix elements for a given set of samples\r\n- X: flips the spin, does not give phase factor\r\n- Y: flips the spin, gives a phase factor\r\n- Z: does not flip the spin, gives a phase factor\r\n- I: does not flip the spin, does not change the phase\r\nWe see that we can know in advance which operators affect the \"mels\" (matrix elements) and which create \"connected elements\" different from the input element. The \"+\" and \"-\" will now need to be parsed as well. However, these now generate 0 matrix elements, and hence, we will need to store the locations of such \"ladder operators\". Once this is known, we know that it will often happen that the corresponding matrix elements vanish, and that there is therefore not always a connected element for each sample (in contrary to other PauliStrings which always have 1 connected element).\r\n\r\nOnce we have this implemented, we can do many things like fermionic operators much more efficiently and consistently, which opens up the road to quantum chemistry with NetKet!\r\n", "closed_by": null}, {"name": "Implement single-pass statistics estimators for variance and convergence estimators", "issue_num": 1220, "value": 75, "number": 1220, "state": "open", "title": "Add single-pass online statistics support to `nk.stats.Stats` ", "created_at": "2022-05-30T16:37:22Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-30T21:24:17Z", "closed_at": null, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "body": "[This issue is part of [UnitaryHack](https://unitaryhack.dev/) and comes with a bounty of 75$]\r\n\r\n**Context**\r\nIn NetKet we want to extract some statistical informations from an estimator, such as mean, variance, error of mean as well as convergence indicators such as `correlation time` and `R_hat`.\r\n\r\nThe standard way to do that is through the `netket.stats.statistics` function in the `netket.stats` submodule.\r\nThis function takes as input a set of `M` chains of `N` samples of a random scalar variables, passed as an `MxN` matrix of real or complex numbers.\r\n\r\nThe function returns a `netket.stats.Stats` object, which is a (frozen) python dataclass which stores the three quantities mentioned before:\r\n -

Plus, I would prefer to have a solution that has already made choices that work, rather than us having to make all of those choices ourselves.\n\n### Additional Context\n\n_No response_", "closed_by": null}], "full_title": "qutip/qutip", "name": "qutip", "full_name": "qutip/qutip", "html_url": "https://github.com/qutip/qutip", "description": "QuTiP: Quantum Toolbox in Python", "created_at": "2012-10-09T06:20:46Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-30T17:38:17Z", "size": 56376, "stargazers_count": 1225, "watchers_count": 1225, "language": "Python", "forks_count": 527, "open_issues_count": 151, "subscribers_count": 78, "license": {"key": "bsd-3-clause", "name": "BSD 3-Clause \"New\" or \"Revised\" License", "spdx_id": "BSD-3-Clause", "url": "https://api.github.com/licenses/bsd-3-clause", "node_id": "MDc6TGljZW5zZTU="}, "topics": ["python", "quantum", "quantum-computing", "quantum-information", "quantum-mechanics", "quantum-optics", "quantum-toolbox", "qutip", "unitaryhack"], "uh_prs": []}, "PyZX": {"title": "PyZX", "emoji": "\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f", "project_url": "https://github.com/Quantomatic/pyzx", "metaDescription": "Python library for quantum circuit rewriting and optimisation using the ZX-calculus", "date": "28/03/2022 00:00:00", "summary": "Python library for quantum circuit rewriting and optimisation using the ZX-calculus", "tags": ["python", "quantum-computing", "quantum-compilation"], "bounties": [{"name": "Implement graphical fourier transform and inverse", "issue_num": 92, "value": 50, "number": 92, "state": "open", "title": "Implement graphical fourier transform and inverse", "created_at": "2022-05-18T11:50:12Z", "updated_at": "2022-05-18T11:50:12Z", "closed_at": null, "assignee": null, "assignees": [], "body": "Implement the graphical Fourier transform, and its inverse.

The pass does the trick while working with `CommutativeCancellation`. However, there are some aspects that are not very well covered and I think it is time to sit again with it and think it over again. Here there are a list of the problems:\r\n\r\n## property `commutation_set` is a messy dict\r\n\r\nThe property `property_set['commutation_set']` is a non-uniformly typed dict:\r\n```python\r\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\r\n\r\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(1)\r\ncircuit.h(0)\r\n\r\nfrom qiskit.transpiler.passes import CommutationAnalysis\r\n\r\nproperty_set = {}\r\nCommutationAnalysis()(circuit, property_set)\r\n\r\nfor k,v in property_set['commutation_set'].items():\r\n    print(type(k), type(v))\r\n```\r\n```\r\n<class 'qiskit.circuit.quantumregister.Qubit'> <class 'list'>\r\n<class 'tuple'> <class 'int'>\r\n<class 'tuple'> <class 'int'>\r\n<class 'tuple'> <class 'int'>\r\n```\r\n\r\n**suggested solution**: `property_set['commutation_set']` should be a `qiskit.dagcircuit.dagdependency.DAGDependency`.\r\n\r\n## does not handle intransitivity\r\n\r\nThe current commutation analysis assumes transitivity (I think), while the relation is intransitive. For example `H` commutes with `I`  and `I` commutes with `Z`, but `H` does not commute with `Z`. This is not reflected in the commutative set:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nfrom qiskit.circuit import Qubit\r\nfrom qiskit.dagcircuit import DAGOpNode\r\n\r\ndef pp_commutation_set(property_commutation_set):\r\n    # pretty printer of the commutation set\r\n    for qbit, sets in property_commutation_set.items():\r\n        if not isinstance(qbit, Qubit):\r\n            continue\r\n        print(qbit.index)\r\n        for commutation_set in sets:\r\n            r=[]\r\n            for node in commutation_set:\r\n                if isinstance(node, DAGOpNode):\r\n                    r.append(f\"{node.op.name}_{node._node_id}{[arg.index for arg in node.qargs]}\")\r\n            if r:\r\n                print('\\t', r)\r\n\r\nfrom qiskit import QuantumCircuit\r\n\r\ncircuit = QuantumCircuit(1)\r\ncircuit.h(0)\r\ncircuit.id(0)\r\ncircuit.z(0)\r\n\r\nfrom qiskit.transpiler.passes import CommutationAnalysis\r\n\r\nproperty_set = {}\r\nCommutationAnalysis()(circuit, property_set)\r\n\r\npp_commutation_set(property_set['commutation_set'])\r\n```\r\n```\r\n0\r\n\t ['h_2[0]', 'id_3[0]', 'z_4[0]']\r\n```\r\n\r\n## There is a lot of duplication with `DAGDependency`\r\n\r\nThe `qiskit.dagcircuit.dagdependency.DAGDependency` seems to do the same as `qiskit.transpiler.passes.optimization.commutation_analysis.CommutationAnalysis`.
