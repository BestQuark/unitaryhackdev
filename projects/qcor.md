QCOR promotes a kernel-based programming model for quantum-classical computing in C++. The QCOR runtime provides a robust set of data structures enabling variational 
quantum algorithm expression and execution, multi-mode kernel execution, and just-in-time quantum code compilation. QCOR also provides a first-of-its-kind MLIR dialect for quantum computing that enables compilation of quantum programs in OpenQASM 3.
