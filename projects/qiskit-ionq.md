[Qiskit-IonQ](https://github.com/Qiskit-Partners/qiskit-ionq) is an open-source SDK that extends the main [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org) codebase to allow users to run qiskit circuits on IonQ Hardware.

> For support, we recommend [joining the Qiskit Slack](https://ibm.co/joinqiskitslack) and using the `#partners-ionq` channel for specific`#qiskit-dev` and `#qiskit-pr-help` might be a good place for questions on the development and the PRing process respectively.
