[Orquestra Core] is a collection of open-source libraries developed at [Zapata Computing](https://www.zapatacomputing.com/). It currently consists of the following packages:

- [orquestra-core](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-core) â€“Â a "meta-package" which contains code examples and provides an easy installation option.
- [orquestra-quantum](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-quantum) â€“Â all the general quantum computing capabilities: data structures, circuits, interfaces for quantum backends, etc.
- [orquestra-opt](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-opt)Â â€“Â data structures and interfaces for optimizers, cost functions, etc.
- [orquestra-vqa](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-vqa) â€“ algorithms and tools for running variational quantum algorithms such as VQE or QAOA.
- [orquestra-qiskit](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-qiskit) â€“Â integration with Qiskit and IBM backends.
- [orquestra-cirq](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-cirq) â€“ integration with CirQ.
- [orquestra-forest](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-forest) â€“Â integration with Forest platform: PyQuil and QVM simulator.


For the ease of browsing, we added all the issues to the [orquestra-core](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-core) repository, even if the changes should be actually made in other repositories â€“Â please see the description of the issues for more details.

Unfortunately, we're still working on the documentation. For now you can either refer to the [integration tests](https://github.com/zapatacomputing/orquestra-core/tree/main/tests) or the source code of the particular package.
