PyZX (pronounce like "physics" but with a P instead of a PH) is a Python tool implementing the theory of ZX-calculus for the creation, visualisation, and automated rewriting of large-scale quantum circuits. Have a look at this [2-minute video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iC-KVdB8pf0) for a short introduction.
